        Thanks for stopping by!
        This site is still very much in the works and probably doesn't look great on mobile.
        I plan to use it as place to share my thoughts in the blog.
        In the future, I will also be adding my photography and software portfolios.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will plan to upload a new blog post roughly every Sunday morning!

        <p>How much does it cost to tap on the shoulder of a software developer at work? We know software development takes a lot of mental energy and focus, but surely it can’t be that hard to just “get back into it” after Joe walks by your desk and asks you about your lunch plans.</p>

<p>I like to think of the brain as the body’s version of random access memory (RAM). At any given time, you have a finite amount of RAM available for your system. Just as opening and using programs consumes the available RAM on your computer, storing thoughts in your mind uses up your brain’s available “RAM”.</p>

        The Importance of Manual

        <h2 id="why-do-we-automate">Why do we automate?</h2>

<p>This is a particularly controversial question for me to ask given that my field involves continuing to push the envelope of what is possible with automation. However, I still think it’s an important question, and I think the answer lies in the concepts of “problems” and “patience”.</p>

<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486908970&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+subtle+art+of+not+giving+a+f---+mark+manson&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=movquo-20&amp;linkId=e40c57248cf654eb6b3611c43a0c6dcc">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a>, Mark Manson suggests, “Problems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded.” Time is a finite resource, whereas there appear to be no shortage of problems that need solving. It would seem that the entire point of computer science and software engineering is to identify common problems that can be automated, so that we need not spend any more time on them, and the subsequent problems that take their place are “upgraded”.</p>
