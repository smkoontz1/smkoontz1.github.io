<p>This is a particularly controversial question for me to ask given that my field involves continuing to push the envelope of what is possible with automation. However, I still think itâ€™s an important question, and I think the answer lies in the concepts of â€œproblemsâ€ and â€œpatienceâ€.</p>

<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486908970&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+subtle+art+of+not+giving+a+f---+mark+manson&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=movquo-20&amp;linkId=e40c57248cf654eb6b3611c43a0c6dcc">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a>, Mark Manson suggests, â€œProblems never stop; they merely get exchanged and/or upgraded.â€ Time is a finite resource, whereas there appear to be no shortage of problems that need solving. It would seem that the entire point of computer science and software engineering is to identify common problems that can be automated, so that we need not spend any more time on them, and the subsequent problems that take their place are â€œupgradedâ€.</p>
